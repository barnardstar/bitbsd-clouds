### This is rootshell jail ###

with this one you can do stuff as root, as real one

`host:/home/user@ #  sudo su`

**Attention! For security purposes this jail has no normal internet connection, while you still can access internet via proxy socks5://192.168.0.199:9050 or http://192.168.0.199:8123**

Or you can also simply execute any command with torsocks prefix

`torsocks ssh rmtusr@myserver.domain.com`
